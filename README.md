Problem statement - To determine the purchasing behavior and preferences for Diwali sales based on gender, marital status, zone, and occupation 

Abstract- 
This project aims to understand how people shop during Diwali, looking at different factors like gender, where they live, and what jobs they have. It will analyze sales data from past Diwalis to find patterns in how people spend money. The goal is to use this information to make smarter marketing plans and choose which products to sell. By using data to understand customers better, the project hopes to improve sales strategies, make customers happier, and make more money during Diwali. It wants to create ads and promotions that match what different groups of people like to buy. Overall, the project hopes to make both shoppers and sellers happy during Diwali by understanding what they want and need.


Objective-
The primary objective is to analyze sales data to enhance customer experience and drive revenue growth through actionable insights.
